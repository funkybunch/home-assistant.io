title: "Assist - Default Sentences"
---

Home Assistant comes with built-in sentences [contributed by the community](https://github.com/home-assistant/intents/) for [dozens of languages](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/voice/intent-recognition/supported-languages).
These sentences allow you to:

* **Turn entities on and off**
    * *"turn on the living room light"*
    * *"turn off ceiling fan"*
* **Open and close covers**
    * *"Close the garage door"*
    * *"Open kitchen window"*
* **Set the brightness and color of lights**
    * *"Change kitchen lights brightness to 50%"*
    * *"Set bed light to green"*
    
In addition to individual entities, commands can target **areas**:

* *"turn on all lights in the living room"*
* *"open windows in the kitchen"*
* *"change kitchen brightness to 50%"*
* *"set bedroom lights to green"*

Entity [aliases](/docs/assist/aliases) are also matched so multiple names can be used, even in different languages.

You can extend the built-in sentences or [add your own](/docs/assist/custom_sentences) to trigger any action in Home Assistant.
